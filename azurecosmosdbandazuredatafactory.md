### I came up with a secondary way as well to ensure our requirements are fullfilled in this way as well
### Periodic Data Archiving from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage
Objective: Regularly export data from Azure Cosmos DB to Azure Blob Storage for backup and archival purposes. 

Steps:

Set Up Azure Data Factory:

Create an ADF instance if you haven't already.​

In the ADF portal, create linked services for both Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Blob Storage.​

Create Datasets:

Source Dataset: Define a dataset pointing to your Cosmos DB container.​

Sink Dataset: Define a dataset pointing to the desired Blob Storage location.​

Design the Pipeline:

Copy Activity: Use the Copy Activity to transfer data from Cosmos DB to Blob Storage.​

Configure the source to read data from Cosmos DB, possibly using a query to filter the data as needed.

Set the sink to write data to Blob Storage, specifying the desired file format (e.g., JSON, Parquet) and naming conventions.

Schedule the Pipeline: Set up a trigger to run this pipeline at regular intervals (e.g., daily, weekly) to ensure data is archived periodically.​

On-Demand Data Restoration from Blob Storage to Cosmos DB
Objective: Restore archived data from Blob Storage back into Azure Cosmos DB when required.​

Steps:

Create a New Pipeline in ADF:
Design a pipeline that reads data from Blob Storage and writes it to Cosmos DB.​

Configure Datasets:
Source Dataset: Define a dataset pointing to the location in Blob Storage where the archived data resides.​
Sink Dataset: Define a dataset pointing to the target Cosmos DB container.​

Design the Pipeline Activities:
Copy Activity: Set up the Copy Activity to read data from Blob Storage and insert or upsert it into Cosmos DB.​
Ensure that the data format in Blob Storage matches the expected schema in Cosmos DB.
Handle any necessary data transformations within ADF if schema differences exist.

Handle Large Files:
Be mindful of Cosmos DB's document size limit (2 MB). If dealing with large files, consider splitting them into smaller chunks during the archiving process.​

Monitor and Manage the Pipeline:
Use ADF's monitoring tools to track the pipeline's execution and address any issues that arise during the data restoration process.​

### services required to achieve our requirement
Azure Cosmos DB
A globally distributed, multi-model NoSQL database service.
Stores your primary operational data.
Supports triggers and change feed for real-time data processing.​

Azure Blob Storage
Object storage solution for the cloud.
Used to archive data from Cosmos DB.
Supports different access tiers: Hot, Cool, and Archive.​

Azure Data Factory (ADF)
Data integration service for creating data-driven workflows.
Facilitates the movement and transformation of data between Cosmos DB and Blob Storage.
Can be used to schedule periodic backups of Cosmos DB data to Blob Storage.
